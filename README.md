## Weiyao Wang

I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. I work with Professor Gregory Hager on reinforcement learning for robotics control and Professor Mathias Unberath on computer vision for medical application. I completed my undergraduate degree at the Duke University in Durham, North Carolina with major in Computer Science and Statistics and worked with Professor Lawrence Carin in deep generative models.  Between PhD and undergrad, I worked at Mckinsey & Company as business analyst in Greater China Region, focused on TMT related strategy/management consulting.
