## Bio

I am a **Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at the Johns Hopkins University** in Baltimore, Maryland. I work with Professor Gregory Hager on reinforcement learning for robotics control and Professor Mathias Unberath on computer vision for medical application. I completed my undergraduate program at the Duke University in Durham, North Carolina with major in Computer Science and Statistics and worked with Professor Lawrence Carin in deep generative models.  Between Ph.D. and undergrad, I worked at Mckinsey & Company as business analyst in Greater China Region, focused on TMT related strategy/management consulting. I also did internship at Facebook during undergrad.
