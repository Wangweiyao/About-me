## Bio

I am a 3rd year **Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at the Johns Hopkins University** in Baltimore, Maryland. I work with Prof. Gregory Hager on **reinforcement learning** for robotics control and Prof. Mathias Unberath on **computer vision** for medical applications. I completed my undergraduate program at the Duke University in Durham, North Carolina with double major in Computer Science & Statistics and worked with Prof. Lawrence Carin in deep generative models.  

Between grad school and college graduation, I worked at Mckinsey & Company as Business Analyst in Greater China Region, focused on TMT related strategy/management consulting. During undergrad, I also did a software enginnering internship at Facebook and a research internship at UC Berkeley with Prof. Dawn Song and Prof. Bo Li.
